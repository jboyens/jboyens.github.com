title: Fixing Grails Dependency Resolution
---

p. In Grails 1.2 an Ivy dependency resolution DSL was added to
BuildConfig.groovy that allowed you to specify your dependency resolution in
Groovy.

hard to add it and I'm going to try my hand at fixing it in the next few days,
but in the meantime, I've come up with a workaround.

p. The workaround (really hacky I may add) is below:
