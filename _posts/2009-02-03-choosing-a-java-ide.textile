title: Choosing a Java IDE
---

p. Ahh. Java IDEs. They make life easier. I couldn't imagine living without the ability to refactor easily, or to see all of the methods a class exposes. No matter your position on IDEs, you can agree that a good editor is a tool that no developer should be without.

p. I've looked around and, as I see it, there are three IDEs in the Java space (in no particular order): Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Netbeans. Eclipse and Netbeans are free and open-source, IDEA is not.




Thoughts:

IDEA:
* slow
* pricey
* GREAT inspections
* Good integration with technologies
* Responsive to bugs
* Good EAP program
* Odd drive caching that seems to beat the crap out of HDs

Netbeans:
* Fast
* Uses ANT for everything
* Lags behind significantly
* More stable
* Run by Sun

Eclipse:
* SWT
* SLOW on anything that isn't Windows
* Buggy
* De-facto starting point
* Lots of plugins
